# Rust-Python Integration with AsyncIO and Multiprocessing

This project demonstrates the integration of Rust with Python for performance-critical tasks. The code utilizes a hybrid approach, combining Rust for heavy computations, Python's asyncio for asynchronous programming, and multiprocessing for parallelism.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-python-integration.git

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code:

python main.py

                                     Overview
main.py: The main Python script orchestrating the Rust integration, async IO, and multiprocessing.
rust_module: Rust code for heavy computation, compiled as a shared library.
RustPythonIntegration: A Python class encapsulating the integration logic.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Rust (for compiling the Rust module)

                                       Usage
Modify the Rust code in rust_module to suit your specific heavy computation requirements.
Adjust the Python code in main.py and RustPythonIntegration as needed.
